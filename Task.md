Task -I(Employee Management System Development)

Develop a robust and scalable Employee Management System that allows an administrator to manage employee data, including the ability to add, update, delete, and search employee records. The system should handle a large number of records efficiently and provide a responsive user interface for seamless interactions.

Validation:
1. Ensure that employee data is validated on both the frontend (e.g., name, email, and contact number) and backend (e.g., checking for duplicate records and invalid data).
2. Implement an efficient search mechanism to allow administrators to search employee records by various attributes (e.g., name, department).
3. Handle user inputs securely, ensuring protection against SQL injection and other common vulnerabilities.
4. Optimise the system for handling large datasets by implementing pagination or lazy loading in the frontend.
5. Update Requirement: To test the functionality, update at least three employee records with different data types, such as changing names, departments, or job titles. Ensure that the updates are reflected correctly in the system.

Expectations:
1. Frontend: Develop a clean, responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The interface should be intuitive, with clear navigation for adding and managing employee data.
2. Backend: Use PHP to build the server-side logic. Ensure the system is capable of managing multiple requests and handling data efficiently using MySQL for storage.
3. AJAX: Use AJAX for dynamically updating the employee list, without requiring page reloads. Ensure real-time updates for actions like adding, editing, or deleting records.
4. Security: Implement input validation to prevent incorrect data submission. Also, apply proper authentication mechanisms to restrict access to only authorised users.
